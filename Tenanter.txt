________________


One‑sentence + 2–3 line summary
One‑liner: Tenanter is an evidence‑first tenant screening copilot for small landlords.
Summary (2–3 lines):
 Tenanter verifies identity/SSN, income/employment, criminal/eviction history (where legal), and authentic prior‑landlord references—then delivers a transparent, evidence‑backed report in 24–48 hours. We combine human‑in‑the‑loop operations with AI agents (voice calling, document forensics, and deep web research) so DIY landlords get professional‑grade screening without hiring a property manager.
________________


Product hypothesis
1. DIY landlords are leaving risk on the table (missed checks, fake documents, fake landlord references).

2. They don’t want a black‑box “score”; they want verifiable evidence and simple decisions.

3. If we deliver an audit‑ready report faster than they can do it themselves—and cheaper than an agent— they will pay per applicant and reuse Tenanter for every vacancy.

________________


Positioning
   * For: Independent landlords (1–20 doors) who self‑manage or use partial services.

   * Promise: Professional‑grade screening without the overhead, bias, or black‑box opacity.

   * Wedge: Evidence‑first + human‑vetted AI that closes the gaps: income fraud, fake refs, sloppy adverse‑action workflows.

What Tenanter does (offerings)
Core, required checks (today)
      1. Identity & SSN verification

         * Government ID capture + selfie/liveness.

         * SSN match (consent‑based). Death‑file flag where applicable.

         * Synthetic identity heuristics (DOB/SSN issuance anomalies, address history mismatches).

            2. Income & employment verification

               * Payroll/bank connection (with applicant consent) to confirm employer, pay frequency, net deposits.

               * Automatic reconciliation: stated income ↔ deposits ↔ pay stubs.

               * Doc forensics on uploaded pay stubs/W‑2s (PDF metadata, layer inconsistencies, templating patterns).

                  3. Credit, eviction, and criminal history (where legal)

                     * Pull rental‑relevant credit signals.

                     * Eviction and landlord‑tenant civil filings (with known data‑quality disclaimers).

                     * Criminal checks aligned to local rules (no blanket bans; arrests ≠ convictions; fair‑chance workflows).

                        4. Prior‑landlord verification

                           * Voice AI agent plus human QA to call prior (not current) landlords, with recording & disclosure.

                           * Authenticity checks: county assessor/property tax databases, business registrations, rent roll artifacts, lease naming consistency, and knowledge‑based questions (rent amount, dates, unit details, deposit terms).

                           * Fake‑ref detection: mismatch between claimed owner and deed records; prepaid mobile patterns; email/domain mismatch.

                              5. Adverse‑action helper & compliance kit

                                 * Capture applicant consent at intake; deliver copy of report.

                                 * Pre‑filled adverse‑action notices when a decision is influenced by report contents.

                                 * Time‑stamped audit log (what was checked, when, by whom).

AI‑enabled extensions (LLM + agents, near‑term)
                                    * Landlord‑call copilot: Generates tailored KBA questions; live monitors calls and prompts follow‑ups; stores transcripts with summaries.

                                    * Automated deep research: Targeted crawling of public records (business filings, small‑claims portals, housing court calendars), and reputable news/legal databases to surface landlord‑tenant disputes tied to the applicant’s identity (name + prior addresses + employer).

                                    * Document fraud classifier: LLM‑assisted reasoning over doc structure + traditional forensic signals; labels confidence and cites anomalies.

                                    * Narrative “Evidence Brief”: LLM synthesizes all artifacts into a short, source‑linked brief; every claim is backed by a document, database hit, or call log.

                                    * Policy guardrails: LLM policy engine that red‑flags use of protected‑class features and enforces decision rules you set (e.g., “Monthly rent ≤ 30% of verified gross income unless co‑signer present”).

                                    * Dispute assistant: If an applicant disputes something, an agent guides the re‑verification workflow and tracks outcomes.

Optional signals (with clear boundaries)
                                       * Rental‑payment verification: Identify recurring rent‑like payments in bank data from prior lease.

                                       * Address history reconstruction: Utility bills, USPS NCOA patterns, credit header data (where permissible).

                                       * Reference triangulation: Prior neighbors or building managers only with consent and in line with local laws.

We explicitly do not infer or use any protected attributes (race, religion, disability, family status, etc.), and we avoid social media “character” inference.

The Tenanter report (what the landlord receives)
                                          * Dashboard view: Pass / Needs Review / Fail by section.

                                          * Evidence Brief: 1–2 pages with citations (click to the artifact: transcript, doc, database record).

                                          * Exceptions list: Any mismatch or uncertainty, with recommended follow‑ups.

                                          * Decision checklist: You set thresholds; we compute them (e.g., income‑to‑rent ratio, collections, recent evictions).

                                          * Adverse‑action generator: One click to produce the required notices and share the report with the applicant.

How it works (copy block)
                                             1. Invite the applicant → They consent and connect payroll/bank; upload ID and any requested docs.

                                             2. Tenanter verifies → Identity/SSN, income, history checks, and we call prior landlords (no fake references).

                                             3. You get an evidence‑first report in 24–48h—with every claim backed by a source.

                                             4. Decide confidently → Approve, ask for a co‑signer, or send an adverse‑action notice in one click.

Compliance, privacy, fairness (tell‑it‑like‑it‑is)
                                                * We run consent‑based checks and provide the applicant a copy of the report upon request.

                                                * We support adverse‑action notices when a decision is influenced by report contents.

                                                * We separate facts (verified) from opinions (risk notes) and never use protected attributes.

                                                * We keep a full audit trail and store PII in a segregated, access‑controlled vault.

                                                * Criminal data is handled where legal, with fair‑chance guidance and no “arrest‑only” disqualifications.

What makes Tenanter different
                                                   * Evidence over scores. Every claim is referenced and reviewable.

                                                   * Close the real gaps. Fake pay stubs and fake landlords are the biggest holes—our AI + human workflow targets those.

                                                   * 24–48h SLA. If we miss it, you don’t pay.

                                                   * DIY‑friendly. Keep control; pass the fee to applicants; no subscription required to start.

Risks & our stance
                                                                              * Data quality in eviction/criminal datasets: we surface source and recency, and we never treat “arrests” as disqualifying.

                                                                              * Over‑automation risk: AI drafts; humans approve. No unsourced claims.

                                                                              * Regulatory variance by city/state: we ship with templates and toggles; landlord chooses what to run.

                                                                              * Ethics: No social media profiling, no protected‑class inference, no shadow scoring.

 Yes—upload documents; we’ll run doc forensics and request alternative proof (W‑2 + prior rent receipts). Confidence is labeled.

                                                                                 * Can I pass the fee to applicants?
 Yes. Add the screening link to your listing and lease instructions.

                                                                                 * Do you integrate with my current listing/lease tool?
 We provide a shareable application link and exportable PDFs. Integrations (Zillow/Avail/DoorLoop/etc.) are on the roadmap as we scale.
